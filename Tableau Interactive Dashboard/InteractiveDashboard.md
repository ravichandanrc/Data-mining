Ever since watching Moneyball, I always wanted to get a practical taste of how Analytics plays an instrumental role in predicting and determining the best strategies that a team/player should pursue. Thanks to Mad About Sports and Mr.David Gladson, for leading this amazing 7-day workshop on Cricket Analytics using Python, I could get a different perspective of the game.

As a part of the workshop, I've worked on some very interesting case studies and the usage of analytics in the cricketing world. I would recommend this workshop to anyone who is ardent about the game and desires to look at it from an Analytical lens.

Post this workshop, as a part of an assignment, I worked on a problem statement - "Is MS Dhoni still good enough to bat?" This is not a yes or no answer, but a dive into the statistics of MSD as a batter by leveraging the IPL data available.

I haven't considered his captaincy or wicket-keeping skills here, we all know he is a Master of it. The EDA includes analyzing the role MS Dhoni plays for CSK by finding patterns in his stats at the middle and death overs, his ability to rotate the strike and also be a slogger at the end, highlighting the advantage of home ground, and other general stats by turning the spotlight on the last two seasons.
